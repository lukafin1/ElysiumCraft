# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#           Welcome to the main configuration of AnimeX
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Following tips applies to all AnimeX's files, so they are not
# mentioned multiple times.
#
# 1) Color codes are supported with the '&' character, see
#    http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes for usage
#
# 2) Unicode /special characters/ only work when files are saved in 
#    UTF-8 encoding. Tested on Notepad++, WordPad on Windows is broken.
#
# 3) JSON is supported when possible. To use it, prepend the message with '[JSON]'.
#    NB: Please use either quotes (a.) or write the json on a new line using |-
#        in the .yml files (recommended) (b.). Examples:
#        a) Warn_Message: '[JSON] {"text": "Hello World"}'
#        b) Example_Message: |-
#           [JSON]
#           {"text": "Hover Me","hoverEvent": {"action": "show_text","value": {"text": "Hey there!"}}}
#
# 4) For placeholder list, visit the variables/global.txt file.

# Settings that affect the performance.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance:

  # Flush the scrolling text on every animation refresh?
  # If false, variables will only be displayed when they are completelly
  # visible, e.g. {player} (but not '{pla', which leeds to artefacts)
  Variables_In_Scroller: true
  
  # [!] Following option is unsafe and might be harmful to your server!
  # Keep processing off the main thread. Highly advised NOT to enable
  # unless you are running some hub server where players don't stay for too long.
  # Some animation plugins do this to claim they cause zero lag.
  Async_Animations: false

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Advanced settings. Change is recommended only if:
# a) you know what you are doing & the consequences
# b) you have been navigated to change it by the support
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced:

  # Caching animations will make animations that starts upon player join
  # re-launch after reload, without the need of player re-joining again.
  # [NB] This feature is in development. Bugs might occur.
  Cache: true

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tells detailed info in the console about various events/configurations.
# [TIP] Don't be afraid to turn this on, it will help you understand
# what you have set up and thus enabling you to solve issues by yourself.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example of all possible sections being debugged:
#Debugger:
#  - animation
#  - listener
#  - scoreboard
#  - cache
Debugger: []

# Variables-related settings.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
  
  # If Vault is present, enforce player's prefix/suffix to contain prefix/suffix from each of their group?
  # Limitation: They are only displayed if the player has assigned multiple groups, not when a group inheritances multiple prefixes from others.
  Vault:
    Multi_Prefix: false
    Multi_Suffix: false
