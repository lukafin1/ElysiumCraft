    &8[&4-&8] &e&lWelco ver! &8[&4-&8]
    &8[&4-&8] &e&lWelcome  server! &8[&4-&8]

    [repeats=5] &8[&4-&8] &e&lWelcome {player} to the server! &8[&4-&8]
    [repeats=6] {col_second}Did you &eknow {col_second}that this server is running &bAnimeX{col_second}?
    [repeats=6] {col_second}You can configure this in the animations folder!
    [repeats=6] {col_second}Bossbar has currently max refresh speed &610 ticks{col_second}!

# All values like '10 seconds', '2 minutes' or '1 hour' are valid.
Delay: 10 ticks

# Repeats set to -1 means this animation is infinite.
Repeats: -1

Advanced:

  # Priority controls overlapping.
  #
  # If there is already an animation playing, and the new one has a higher
  # priority, it overlaps the old animation and player will see the new one, 
  # otherwise they will keep seeing the old animation.
  #
  # The old animation will be hibernated and restored once the new animation finishes.
  Priority: 1
  
  # Where to begin the next repeat. Used to skip first slide(s) from repeatings.
  # Example: consider following slides:
  # (index=0) - Welcome to the server
  # (index=1) - Visit our site: www.example.com
  # (index=2) - Play awesome games at /event
  # And you would like to start the animation when player joins and repeat it infinitely, but without the first welcome message.
  # Setting the index to 1 would you allow this.
  Repeat_Index: 4
