# Where to begin the next repeat in title. Used to skip first slide(s) from repeatings.
# Example: consider following slides:
# (index=0) - Welcome to the server
# (index=1) - Visit our site: www.example.com
# (index=2) - Play awesome games at /event
# And you would like to start the animation when player joins and repeat it infinitely, but without the first welcome message.
# Setting the index to 1 would you allow this.
Title_Repeat_Index: 11

# All slides/rows on the scoreboard are displayed at once,
# you can use properties to make then change.
# Minecraft can only handle 15 rows at the scoreboard.
#
# Different properties in [] brackets can be specified for each row.
