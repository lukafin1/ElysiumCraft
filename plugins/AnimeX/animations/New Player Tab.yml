# Animations that support multiline, like this one,
# can have multiple lines in every slide, so this is like a list.
# The - is a one key of the list, and the |- character means the program will read each line as a new one.
#
# Different properties in [] brackets can be specified for each line.

  # If there is already an animation playing, and the new one has a higher
  # priority, it overlaps the old animation and player will see the new one, 
  # otherwise they will keep seeing the old animation.
  #
  # The old animation will be hibernated and restored once the new animation finishes.
