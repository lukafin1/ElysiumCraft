# Use Bungee-sided command
# If this is enabled and you have PowerfulPerms installed in your Bungee proxy, it will send the /powerfulperms command through Bungee instead of Bukkit.
# Note: This is only meant to be used if you're using Redis or/and you are running PowerfulPerms on Bungee side only.
# If you're not using Redis your Spigot servers won't be notified of permission changes and you will have to reload all servers manually.
# It will also replace/mess with Bukkit sided PowerfulPerms command. 
# Highly recommended to set to false.

# Set "onlinemode: false" if you run your server in offline mode. Set to "onlinemode: mixed" for mixed mode, more details about this on the PowerfulPerms wiki. Defaults to true.
