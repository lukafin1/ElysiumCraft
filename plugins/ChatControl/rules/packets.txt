# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file manages special rules that can overlaps messages sent by other
# plugins or even the server, with the help of packets.
#
# Notable:
# 1) Rules from rules.txt are not included and it only accepts operators below!
# 2) You need ProtocolLib to enable this features.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Operators:
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression to match the checked message.)
# then replace <message> (A word used to replace only the part of the matched message.)
# then rewrite <message> (A message used to replace the whole checked message.)
# then rewritein <world> <message> (A message used to replace the whole checked message in the specified world only. 
#                                   You can use this together with 'rewrite' as a fallback on other worlds. It is possible 
#                                   to add multiple operators in one rule for multiple worlds.)
# dont verbose (Even if you have Verbose enabled the rule will be hidden from appearing in the console.)
# then deny (Message will not be shown in the chat - cancels the packet.)
#
# For variables check the header in rules.txt
