# ---------------------------------------------------------
# This file support creating handlers that are 
# triggered by user-defined rules.
#
# The purpose of a handler is to collect multiple actions and
# use them when a message is caught by a rule. This reduces
# repetitive code and makes things more human and future proof.
# The names are case sensitive.
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# All possible values are commented out below as an example. They are not mandatory to use.
# [THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, DO NOT UNCOMMENT IT, SCROLL DOWN FOR HANDLERS THAT ARE IN USE]
